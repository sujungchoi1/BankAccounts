# Bank Accounts

Create an app that allows users to register and log in. After a user logs in, they should be taken to an account page that displays their bank records.

* Users should be shown an error if they try to withdraw more than their balance.
* If a user tries to access another user's account page, they should be redirected.
* Withdraw and deposit use the same form, which should accept positive or negative numbers.
